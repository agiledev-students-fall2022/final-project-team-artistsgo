# Product Vision

For artistic college students who want to buy/sell their creative services and collaborate with other artists, ArtistsGo is an app that connects students and gives them a platform to market their products.

# Product Description

ArtistsGo allows college students to exchange artistic products and services and also inspire collaboration. At every school, there are creative students who hold incredible talents; people who can do nail art better than salons, make candles, or paint pet portraits for their friends. Through ArtistsGo, fellow students can buy another student's handmade pottery, beaded necklaces, or even dance lessons. Further, ArtistsGo is a platform for student artists to market their products and create a customer base. This application allows users to chose a specific category, such as "candle making", and explore all the product and opportunities related. Even more, ArtistsGo has functions for students to post, chat, and connect.

## History and how to contribute

ArtistsGo was created as a student project in a class named "Agile Development" taught by Amos Bloomberg in the Computer Science department at New York University. Genie Hou thought of the idea and as a team, we developed the final product. ArtistsGo allowed us to practice full stack development as a team. This project was also a way to practice and learn Agile methodologies and SCRUM; we did regular standups, demos, and sprint planning sessions. To contribute, please read [this](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
