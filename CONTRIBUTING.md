# Team Norms

### Working Together:

- Each member will be attentive to the groupchat and Discord channels, making sure that they can be reached within reasonable hours.

- Team members will communicate blockers, bugs, and issues at the end of the day, there will also be separate page for documenting those within this repository while we are still in development.

- If help is needed, the other team members can be asked. If, and only if, the other team member has the capacity to take a look and solve the issue can they do so.

- Conflict resolution will be done over a video call or in person meet up. We believe that text, whether it be Discord or the iMessage groupchat in activity, has the potential to construe team members communication because too much is left open to interpretation (tone, attitude).

- A vote will be held if the issue is too contentious. Considering there are an even amount of people on the ArtistsGo team, the final say will go to that week's Product Owner.

- If a member falls behind and is unable to catch up within a half a sprint, then another group member (given that they are able to handle the workload) will take over their task for that sprint. Consisentcy in not being able to deliver their task (3 weeks) will result in a meeting between the group members and the Professor.

- We believe a two hour window is appropriate when responding to team members. During the weekends, we have agreed that'd we will try our best given that we are still students.
