      <h1>How does ArtistsGo work?</h1>
      <p>
        ArtistsGo is both a marketplace for artistic goods and a platform for
        student artists. A student can register for an account and post items,
        physical goods or services, and give their contact info for customers in
        their description. Students can also just post things they created, or
        things they found cool!
      </p>
      <h1>How do I buy an item I like?</h1>
      <p>
        All transactions are done on your own. Contact the seller with their
        given phone number or email to coordinate a sale. ArtistsGo does not
        handle payments between customers.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I trust ArtistsGo for sales?</h1>
      <p>
        Though we do not handle transactions, the sellers and buyers are mostly
        college students in your community. This creates a safer space to buy
        and sell.
      </p>
      <h1>How do I login or register for an account?</h1>
      <p>
        Simply navigate to the side bar and click on the login tab. There, you
        are able to both login or register for an account.
      </p>
